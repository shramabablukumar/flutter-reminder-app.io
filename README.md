Hereâ€™s a detailed description of how to use the Flutter Reminder App project after setup:

### **How to Use the Reminder App**

#### 1. **Clone the Project from GitHub**
   - First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
     ```bash
     git clone <your-github-repository-url>
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd flutter-reminder-app
     ```

#### 2. **Open the Project in an IDE**
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as **Visual Studio Code** or **Android Studio**. 
   - If using Visual Studio Code:
     - Install the **Flutter** extension.
     - Open the project folder.

#### 3. **Install Dependencies**
   - In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

#### 4. **Run the Application**
   - Ensure you have a connected physical device or an emulator running.
   - To run the app, use:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - The app should launch on your device or emulator.

#### 5. **User Interface Overview**
   - Once the app is running, you will see a simple UI with three key components:
     - **Dropdown Menu for Selecting the Day**: Select the day of the week for which you want to set reminders.
     - **Time Picker Button**: Tap on the button to select a specific time for the reminder. The time will display on the button itself once chosen.
     - **Dropdown Menu for Selecting Activity**: Choose the activity for which the reminder will be set. Options include "Wake up," "Go to gym," "Meetings," etc.

#### 6. **Set a Reminder**
   - **Step 1**: Select the day of the week using the **first dropdown menu**.
   - **Step 2**: Tap the **time picker button** to choose the reminder time.
   - **Step 3**: Select the activity for the reminder using the **third dropdown menu**.
   - **Step 4**: Press the **"Set Reminder"** button.
   
   Once you press the "Set Reminder" button, a notification will be scheduled. The notification will play a sound when the selected time is reached.

#### 7. **Notifications**
   - The app uses the `flutter_local_notifications` package to display reminders.
   - At the selected time, the notification will trigger, displaying the message **"Time to [Activity]"** (e.g., "Time to Go to the gym").
   - A chime or sound will also play when the notification appears.

#### 8. **Test the Reminder Feature**
   - Once the reminder is set, wait until the selected time to see the notification.
   - The notification will include the activity you selected and trigger at the exact time.
